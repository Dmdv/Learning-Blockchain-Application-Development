Learning Blockchain Application Development [video], published by Packt


There are two folders in this repo:

- _start_ contains the boilerplate code you'll need to follow along with the examples in the course. You'll add your own code as you go in order to build a fully functioning Marketplace. Any code not demonstrated in the course videos has already been completed in this folder.

- _final_ contains the fully functioning application demonstrated during this course. Use this to browse the code on your own, or as a reference if you get stuck writing your own code.
